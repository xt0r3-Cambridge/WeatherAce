We used the following libraries (added as dependencies in module-info.java)
    JavaFX (for GUI)
    ControlsFX (for GUI)
    BootstapFX (for GUI. I am not sure whether we have used them)
    TilesFX (for GUI)
    Ikonli (for icons)
    JSON (for the weather API)
    Lang 3 (for the weather API)

To run the code, run the start() method in
src/main/java/com/group17/hifiprototype/MainApplication.java

Make sure to download any libraries that are required before running the code.
You will also need internet connection to connect to the weather API.
